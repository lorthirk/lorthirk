- 👋 Hi, I’m @lorthirk, and I have absolutely zero imagination... so I'm going to steal Github's template for now.
- 👀 I’m interested in so many things I cannot even keep track of them. Professionally I mainly develop in Java but would love to explore modern languages such as Kotlin or Python. On the peronal side I would name Flight Simulation and Aeronautics in general, and Soccer. 
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to start a little project to get me learning one of the languages mentioned above. I wish it involved [DCS](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com), the Flight Simulator I use the most.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything involved DCS (again!) or whatever I find equally interesting
- 📫 How to reach me: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lorthirk) should be fine
